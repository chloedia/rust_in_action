# My Rust In Action

*This is simply a repo to track my path learning rust by reading and doing the book rust in action projects*

Rules I followed :

* For each exercise, as it gives directly the answer, I asked chatgpt to redact a Pratical Sheet with guided exercises to do the project (which I add in each folders).
* I did not use LLMs during coding the projects (or at least not as a coder but sometimes as a teacher) which leads to exercise correction that are different from the one of the books but it works.
